# Deployment Guide for My Web App  

## 🚀 Overview  
This document explains how to deploy the web application using Docker and CI/CD pipelines.  

## 🛠 Steps to Deploy  

### 1️⃣ **Set Up Docker**  
- Installed Docker and created a `Dockerfile`.  
- Built and pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub.  

### 2️⃣ **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**  
- Configured GitHub Actions to automate deployments.  
- Used a workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).  

### 3️⃣ **Deploy to Cloud**  
- Hosted the app on [Vercel/AWS/Heroku].  
- Set up environment variables and secrets.  

### 4️⃣ **Testing & Logs**  
- Checked if the app is live: [Deployment Link]  
- Verified functionality: Login, API calls, database connections.  
- Monitored logs for any errors.  

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Fixes**  
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Docker login fails | Re-create Docker token in GitHub Secrets |
| CI/CD pipeline doesn’t trigger | Check GitHub Actions for errors |
| Deployment fails | Check hosting logs & update configs |

## 📜 **Final Notes**
